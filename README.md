### Hi there 👋

My name is Will Taylor-Melanson. I'm a 5th year student of Mathematics and Computer Science
(double major) at the University of Prince Edward Island currently completing an
honours project during my final year of study. I work as a software developer
on the AI/ML team at Thinking Big, Inc. in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada.
My research interests include Deep Learning applied to sequence processing and wearable interactive systems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on research in the area of sequence processing using new RNN architectures
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything python, deep learning, or new testing frameworks
- ㊙️ At least two major projects in areas mentioned above hope to go public within the next year.
